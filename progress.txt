## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Nx React/Vite Application
- What was implemented:
  - Added @nx/react plugin to workspace
  - Generated React app with Vite bundler using `nx generate @nx/react:application`
  - Created SUMMARY.md in apps/web/ explaining the application
  - Verified typecheck passes and app runs
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @nx/react, @nx/vite dependencies)
  - apps/web/ directory created with all scaffolded files
  - apps/web/SUMMARY.md created
  - PRD.md updated to mark US-001 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Nx 17+ uses inferred targets, so project.json is optional
  - Use `npx nx sync --yes` if workspace is out of sync before typecheck
  - Web app runs on port 4200 by default with Vite
  - Use `npx nx typecheck @catan/web` to typecheck just the web app

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Install and Configure Mantine
- What was implemented:
  - Installed @mantine/core and @mantine/hooks packages
  - Imported @mantine/core/styles.css in main.tsx
  - Added MantineProvider wrapping the app with defaultColorScheme="auto"
  - Verified typecheck passes and app runs with Mantine configured
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @mantine/core, @mantine/hooks)
  - package-lock.json, yarn.lock (updated dependencies)
  - apps/web/src/main.tsx (added MantineProvider and CSS import)
  - PRD.md updated to mark US-002 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing npm packages due to dependency conflicts in the workspace
  - Mantine v8+ requires explicit CSS import: `import '@mantine/core/styles.css'`
  - Use `defaultColorScheme="auto"` for MantineProvider to respect system preference

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Install and Configure TanStack Router
- What was implemented:
  - Installed @tanstack/react-router package
  - Created apps/web/src/routes/ directory
  - Created __root.tsx with createRootRoute and Outlet component
  - Created index.tsx home page route with createRoute
  - Created router.tsx with router instance and TypeScript module augmentation
  - Updated main.tsx to use RouterProvider instead of App component
  - Created SUMMARY.md in routes directory
  - Verified typecheck passes and app runs
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @tanstack/react-router)
  - apps/web/src/routes/__root.tsx (new)
  - apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx (new)
  - apps/web/src/routes/SUMMARY.md (new)
  - apps/web/src/router.tsx (new)
  - apps/web/src/main.tsx (updated to use RouterProvider)
  - PRD.md updated to mark US-003 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - TanStack Router v1+ requires `createRoute` with `getParentRoute` callback for child routes
  - Don't use `createFileRoute('/')` for manual route tree - use `createRoute` with explicit parent
  - Route tree is built manually in router.tsx using `rootRoute.addChildren([...])`
  - TypeScript module augmentation `declare module '@tanstack/react-router'` needed for type safety
  - Old App component (apps/web/src/app/app.tsx) is now unused, replaced by routes
