## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Nx React/Vite Application
- What was implemented:
  - Added @nx/react plugin to workspace
  - Generated React app with Vite bundler using `nx generate @nx/react:application`
  - Created SUMMARY.md in apps/web/ explaining the application
  - Verified typecheck passes and app runs
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @nx/react, @nx/vite dependencies)
  - apps/web/ directory created with all scaffolded files
  - apps/web/SUMMARY.md created
  - PRD.md updated to mark US-001 complete
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Nx 17+ uses inferred targets, so project.json is optional
  - Use `npx nx sync --yes` if workspace is out of sync before typecheck
  - Web app runs on port 4200 by default with Vite
  - Use `npx nx typecheck @catan/web` to typecheck just the web app
