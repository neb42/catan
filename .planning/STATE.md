## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single lobby model: Friends-only use case, simplest architecture (Pending)
- No user accounts: Reduces complexity, nicknames sufficient for friend groups (Pending)
- Block late arrivals: Simpler than queue/spectator for v0.1 (Good)
- Color stealing mechanic: First-to-ready gets priority, prevents conflicts (Pending)
- 3-4 players only for v0.1: Base game first, expansion later (Good)
- Placeholder game screen: Lobby complete before building actual game (Good)
