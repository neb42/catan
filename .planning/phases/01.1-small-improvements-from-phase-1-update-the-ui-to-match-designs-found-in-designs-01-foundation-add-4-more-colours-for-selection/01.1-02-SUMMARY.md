# Plan 01.1-02 Summary: Component Styling

## Objective
Update component styling to match design mockups while maintaining all existing functionality.

## What Was Built

### Landing Page (Two-Step Process)
- Single card with "Settlers" title and "Explore, Build, Trade" tagline
- Two-step flow: Enter explorer name first, then choose create or join
- "Start New Expedition" button creates room
- "Join Existing Map" shows room code field with "Go" button
- "← Back to menu" link returns to button selection
- Proper Fraunces/Outfit typography
- Slide-up animation on load

### Lobby Page
- "Expedition Party" header centered at top
- Room code pill with inline copy button (circular, teal)
- 2x2 player grid with proper spacing
- Actions bar at bottom with sticky positioning
- Status indicator dot (pulsing)
- "I'm Ready" / "Ready!" button with checkmark icon
- Status messages:
  - "At least 3 players required" (< 3 players)
  - "Waiting for players... X/Y ready" (enough players)
  - "Ready to start!" (all ready)

### Player Cards (2x2 Grid)
- Circular avatars (80px) with player initials (first 2 letters)
- Avatar background color matches player color
- Player name in Fraunces font below avatar
- Ready badge (clickable only for self, disabled for others)
- 8-color inline picker for current player
  - Gray pill containing colored circles
  - All 8 colors selectable: red, blue, white, orange, green, yellow, purple, brown
  - Selected color has thicker border
  - Hover scales up (1.2x)
- Empty slots show "Waiting for player..." with dashed border

### Styling Details
- Background: #F9F4EF warm beige (applied to body and #root)
- Hex decorations visible in background
- All colors work with direct hex values (not CSS variables)
- Button text properly visible using Mantine `styles` prop
- Smooth animations throughout

## Files Modified

- `apps/web/src/app/app.tsx` - Removed unnecessary container, added hex decorations
- `apps/web/src/components/CreateRoom.tsx` - Converted to design-matching card (not used in final flow)
- `apps/web/src/components/JoinRoom.tsx` - Converted to design-matching card (not used in final flow)
- `apps/web/src/components/LandingForm.tsx` - **NEW** Unified two-step landing form
- `apps/web/src/components/Lobby.tsx` - Complete redesign with proper layout and ready button
- `apps/web/src/components/PlayerList.tsx` - 2x2 grid with avatars and 8-color picker
- `apps/web/src/styles.css` - Added color variables, ensured #root background

## Verification

✅ Build passes  
✅ Landing page matches design (two-step flow)  
✅ Lobby page matches design (header, grid, actions bar)  
✅ All 8 colors selectable and syncing via WebSocket  
✅ Ready button shows text and functions correctly  
✅ Other players' badges not clickable  
✅ Background color correct (#F9F4EF)  
✅ Status messages clear and informative  

## Deviations

None. All tasks completed as planned with additional fixes for:
- Button text visibility (used Mantine `styles` prop)
- Color picker functionality (direct hex values instead of CSS variables)
- API cache issue (forced rebuild after constant update)

## Integration Points

- Uses PLAYER_COLORS from `libs/shared/src/constants`
- WebSocket messages for color changes and ready status
- PlayerList component consumed by Lobby
- LandingForm component consumed by Lobby

## Next Steps

Phase 01.1 complete. All UI improvements applied and verified.
