# Phase [01.1] Plan [01]: Design Foundation Summary

**One-liner:** Established 8-player color palette with design system using Fraunces/Outfit typography and CSS custom properties for terracotta/teal/saffron theme

## What Was Built

### 1. Expanded Player Color Palette
- Updated `PLAYER_COLORS` constant from 4 to 8 colors
- Added: green, yellow, purple, brown
- Updated `MAX_PLAYERS` from 4 to 8
- Maintains existing colors first to avoid breaking current player assignments

### 2. Google Fonts Integration
- Added preconnect links for performance optimization
- Loaded Fraunces font family (300, 600, 800 weights)
- Loaded Outfit font family (400, 600, 800 weights)
- Supports design system typography requirements

### 3. Global Design System Styles
- **CSS Custom Properties:**
  - Color palette: terracotta primary (#E76F51), teal secondary (#2A9D8F), saffron accent (#E9C46A)
  - Warm beige background (#F9F4EF)
  - Radius tokens (24px, 12px, full)
  - Shadow values with consistent opacity

- **Typography:**
  - Base font: Outfit (sans-serif) for body text
  - Display font: Fraunces (serif) for headings
  - Configured letter spacing and font weights

- **Player Color Classes:**
  - 8 utility classes (.c-red, .c-blue, .c-white, .c-orange, .c-green, .c-yellow, .c-purple, .c-brown)
  - Colors mapped to design system palette
  - White includes text-shadow for visibility

- **Animations:**
  - `float`: For hex decorations
  - `slideUp`, `fadeIn`, `fadeInDown`, `fadeInUp`: For element entrance
  - `pulse`, `popIn`: For interactive feedback

- **Background Elements:**
  - Dotted radial gradient pattern
  - Hex decoration shapes with floating animation
  - Ambient visual interest without overwhelming UI

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Lines Changed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `libs/shared/src/constants/index.ts` | Added 4 colors, updated MAX_PLAYERS | +2/-2 |
| `apps/web/index.html` | Added Google Fonts preconnect and stylesheet | +3 |
| `apps/web/src/styles.css` | Complete design system CSS | +148/-1 |

## Decisions Made

### Color Palette Strategy
**Context:** Need to expand from 4 to 8 player colors while maintaining design system consistency.

**Decision:** Use design system colors (terracotta, teal, saffron) as basis, supplement with traditional Catan colors (purple, brown, green, yellow).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Generate 8 entirely distinct hues: Would break design system consistency
- Use only design system colors: Insufficient differentiation for 8 players

**Result:** Balanced approach maintains visual cohesion while providing adequate player differentiation.

### Typography Hierarchy
**Context:** Need clear typographic hierarchy for game interface.

**Decision:** Fraunces (serif, high-weight) for headings, Outfit (sans-serif) for body text.

**Rationale:** 
- Fraunces provides distinctive, commanding presence for key UI elements
- Outfit ensures readability for game state, instructions, chat
- Weight variations (300-800) support hierarchy within each family

### CSS Architecture
**Context:** Mantine UI provides component styling; need foundation without conflicts.

**Decision:** Focus on design tokens, utilities, and base element styles only.

**Scope:**
- ✅ Include: CSS custom properties, animations, utility classes, base typography
- ❌ Exclude: Component-specific styles (cards, buttons, inputs)

**Result:** Design system coexists with Mantine without overriding component styles.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Testing & Verification

### Build Verification
✅ `npx nx build web` - Passed (1.99s)
- No TypeScript errors
- CSS compiled successfully
- Bundle size: 205KB CSS, 462KB JS (gzipped: 31KB, 141KB)

### File Verification
✅ 8 colors exported in constants
✅ Google Fonts links present (3 links: 2 preconnect + 1 stylesheet)
✅ CSS contains Fraunces font-family references
✅ CSS custom properties defined (--color-primary: #E76F51)
✅ Animations present (6 keyframe definitions)
✅ Player color classes defined (8 utility classes)

## Integration Points

### Downstream Impacts
- **Component Updates (Phase 01.1 Plans 02-04):** Can now use `.c-{color}` utility classes and design tokens
- **Player Selection:** 8 colors available for lobby color picker
- **Theme Consistency:** All future components should reference CSS custom properties

### Dependencies Satisfied
- ✅ Provides color palette for player selection UI
- ✅ Provides design tokens for component styling
- ✅ Provides animation utilities for interactive elements

## Next Phase Readiness

**Blockers:** None

**Recommendations:**
1. Update existing components to use `.c-{color}` classes instead of inline styles
2. Reference CSS custom properties (var(--color-primary)) in component styles
3. Use animation utilities for consistent motion design
4. Add background pattern/hex decorations to main app layout

## Performance Impact

- **Font Loading:** 2 font families (4 total weights) loaded asynchronously via Google Fonts
- **CSS Size:** +148 lines (~4KB uncompressed)
- **Bundle Impact:** Minimal - design tokens and utilities compress well
- **Runtime:** All styles are static CSS (no JavaScript overhead)

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **8 colors available** - PLAYER_COLORS exports array with 8 strings  
✅ **Fonts loaded** - Google Fonts links in HTML, font-family references in CSS  
✅ **Design tokens present** - CSS custom properties defined for colors, radii, shadows  
✅ **Animations available** - 6 keyframe animations defined in CSS  
✅ **Builds pass** - Web package builds without errors (1.99s)
