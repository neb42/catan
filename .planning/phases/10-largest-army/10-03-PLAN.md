  <name>Task 1: Add Largest Army badge next to holder (knight counts already displayed)</name>
  <files>
    apps/web/src/components/GamePlayerList.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Context:** Knight counts are already displayed in GamePlayerList (lines 162-168 show the existing knight count badge). This task focuses ONLY on adding the Largest Army badge for the holder, matching the Longest Road badge pattern (lines 171-186).

1. Import the new selector at top (around line 17-18, add to existing imports):

```typescript
import {
  useCurrentPlayer,
  useGameStore,
  useTurnCurrentPlayer,
  useLongestRoadHolder,
  usePlayerRoadLengths,
  useLargestArmyHolder, // ADD THIS
} from '../stores/gameStore';
```

2. Add state hook inside the component (around line 48, after longestRoadHolderId):

```typescript
// Largest army state
const largestArmyHolderId = useLargestArmyHolder();
```

3. Inside the player map (around line 71), add largest army check:

```typescript
// Largest army status
const hasLargestArmy = player.id === largestArmyHolderId;
```

4. Add Largest Army badge in the Group with badges, **matching the Longest Road badge pattern (lines 171-186)**. Place immediately after the Longest Road badge:

```typescript
{/* Largest Army badge - matches Longest Road badge pattern */}
{hasLargestArmy && (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
    transition={{
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 500,
      damping: 30,
    }}
  >
    <Tooltip label="Largest Army (2 VP)" position="top">
      <Badge size="sm" color="red" variant="filled">
        🛡️ Largest
      </Badge>
    </Tooltip>
  </motion.div>
)}
```

**Note:** The existing knight count badge (lines 162-168) already shows knight counts. Per phase context decision "Always show count even for players with 0 knights played", verify this badge shows for all players. If wrapped in a conditional, update to always show.
</action>
<verify>
Run `cd apps/web && npm run build` - builds without errors.
Run `npm run dev` and visually verify:

- Knight count badge shows for all players (including 0)
- When a player gets 3+ knights (after testing with dev tools), Largest Army badge appears
  </verify>
  <done>
  GamePlayerList shows Largest Army badge for holder with spring animation, knight counts visible for all players
  </done>
  </task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete Largest Army tracking and UI:
- Backend recalculates largest army on knight plays (min 3 knights required)
- WebSocket broadcasts largest_army_updated on transfers
- Frontend state updates and shows toast notifications
- GamePlayerList displays Largest Army badge (🛡️) for holder
- Knight counts visible for all players
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the dev servers: `npm run dev` (in root)
2. Open 3-4 browser tabs to same room
3. Start game and play through to main phase
4. Have one player buy 3+ knight cards across turns (buy dev card, wait turn, play knight)
5. Verify:
   - Knight count badge updates after each knight play
   - When player reaches 3 knights, Largest Army badge (🛡️) appears with animation
   - Toast notification shows "[Player] earns Largest Army (3 knights)!"
   - Have another player exceed with 4+ knights
   - Verify badge transfers with animation
   - Toast shows "[New Player] earns Largest Army from [Old Player]!"
6. Verify badge matches Longest Road styling (same position, animation pattern)
