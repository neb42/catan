<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete development card system with all 5 card types (Knight, VP, Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly), purchase flow, play restrictions, and UI</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:**
1. Start both servers: `npx nx serve api` and `npx nx serve web`
2. Open two browser windows to http://localhost:4200
3. Create room, join with second player, start game
4. Play through setup phase to reach main game

**Test 1: Buy Dev Card (DEV-01, DEV-02)**

1. Accumulate resources: 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
2. Click "Buy Dev Card" button
3. Verify: Card appears in your hand, resources deducted, deck count decrements
4. Verify: Other player sees your dev card count increase (but NOT card type)

**Test 2: Same-Turn Restriction (DEV-03)**

1. Buy a dev card
2. Try to play it immediately
3. Verify: Card is grayed out with tooltip "Cannot play card purchased this turn"
4. End turn, then on next turn verify card is now playable

**Test 3: One-Per-Turn Restriction (DEV-04)**

1. Have 2+ dev cards (not VP)
2. Play one dev card
3. Try to play another
4. Verify: Second card grayed with tooltip "Already played a dev card this turn"
5. Verify: VP cards (if you have any) are always grayed (they auto-score)

**Test 4: Knight Card (DEV-05)**

1. Play a Knight card
2. Verify: Robber placement overlay appears
3. Move robber to hex with opponent settlement
4. Verify: Steal modal appears, can steal
5. Verify: Knight count increments in player info
6. Verify: Turn continues (can still build, trade, end turn)

**Test 5: Road Building Card (DEV-06)**

1. Play Road Building card
2. Verify: "Place 2 more roads" overlay appears
3. Click valid edge - road placed, counter shows "Place 1 more road"
4. Click another valid edge - road placed, overlay closes
5. Verify: No resources spent for roads

**Test 6: Year of Plenty Card (DEV-07)**

1. Play Year of Plenty card
2. Verify: Modal opens to select 2 resources
3. Select same resource twice (allowed)
4. Submit - verify resources added to hand

**Test 7: Monopoly Card (DEV-08)**

1. Ensure opponent has resources
2. Play Monopoly card
3. Select a resource type
4. Verify: All of that resource taken from all opponents
5. Verify: Toast shows "[You] collected X [resource] via Monopoly!"
6. Verify: Other player sees their resources taken

**Test 8: Victory Point Cards Hidden (DEV-09)**

1. If you have VP cards, verify they show in YOUR hand with star icon
2. Switch to opponent view
3. Verify: Opponent sees your dev card COUNT but NOT that they're VP cards
4. Verify: VP cards grayed with "Victory Point cards score automatically"

**Edge Cases:**

- Buy when deck empty: Button disabled with "Deck is empty" tooltip
- Road Building with 1 road remaining: Should place 1 and complete
- Knight before rolling: Should work (Knight can be played any time during turn)
