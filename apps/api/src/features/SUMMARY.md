# Features Directory

This directory contains feature modules for the API. Each feature is organized into its own subdirectory with related controllers, services, routes, and types.

## Structure

Each feature module typically contains:
- `*.controller.ts` - Request handlers
- `*.service.ts` - Business logic
- `*.routes.ts` - Route definitions
- `*.types.ts` - Feature-specific types

## Usage

Create a new subdirectory for each feature (e.g., `features/auth/`, `features/users/`).
